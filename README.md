# Project Summary
---
Learn to recreate different layouts using HTML and CSS.

This repository contains three different directories [first](first), [second](second), and [third](third).
inside each folder you'll find an `index.html` file, `index.css` file, and a layout reference image file.

The image file is your layout reference. The goal of these exercises is to get your web page layout
to look as much like the reference image as possible. Because there are numerous ways a single layout
could be implemented, this project will not have a guide. However, if you become stuck, there will be
an included solution to help you move forward. Each exercise will have a `solution` folder located
alongside the other files.

Remember, your code does not need to match the solution. The most important aspect is that the web
page you create matches the provided layout reference image as closely as possible.
